# 🏥 Analysis of Medicine Demand&Supply and doctor availability in India

### 🚧 Project Status: Data Modeling Phase
*Currently mapping healthcare density against medicine demand.*

### 🎯 Objective
To analyze the relationship between the number of registered doctors in Indian states and the demand for specific medicines/side-effects.

### 📸 Current Progress: Geospatial Mapping
I have successfully imported the dataset and established the initial geospatial visualization.
* **Visual:** Interactive map showing the density of Total Registered Doctors across Indian States.
* **Goal:** To identify if states with fewer doctors have higher incidents of self-medication or specific medicine demand.

### ⚙️ Technical Stack
* **Tool:** Power BI
* **ETL:** Power Query (Used to clean state names to match Map visuals)
* **Data Model:** Star Schema (In progress)

### 🔜 Next Steps (Roadmap)
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Finalizing the `all_medicine_database` table.
2.  **DAX:** Creating measures to calculate `Doctors per Capita`.
3.  **Visualization:** Adding charts for "Medicine Demand by Region."
